    "Like every great story, ML's story has its own heroes and villians. It has seen darkest of its times when AI-Winter dawned in 1970's. It was almost like people started expecting a sea in a desert, after a few spells of rain. AI and ML becoming self conscious,etc were the kind of promises which were marketed, and the sad part was that computational devices were yet to bloom. That is why **story of GPU's and Story of ML** have a common growth trajactory.\n",

After 3 months, the baby was brought out of the conditional environment.Now, when they kept a vertical stick in front of the cat, it pawned at it, just like a normal cat, but it had **literally no reaction** to horizontal stick . . .  \n",
